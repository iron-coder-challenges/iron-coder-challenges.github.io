title: What is Iron Coder
categories:
---

Iron Coder is a team of CodeNewbies that support and challenge each other with a series of short coding projects.  These projects are designed to build confidence and gain valuable coding experience solving problems in each participantâ€™s language of choice. New projects are delivered every two weeks so there is always something new and interesting to work on.

## How does it work?

Each week, Iron Coders will meet to discuss the challenges that they face and the solutions that they have found to those challenges.  Because new challenges are delivered every two weeks, each meeting will be occur either at the beginning of a project or mid way through the project.

### Project announcement meetings

Because of the short project timeline, every other week will see a project completed and a new project started. These project announcement meetings will give participants a chance to share their experiences and code from the previous project with other members of the group.

Once the concluding project has been discussed, a new project will begin.  This new project will continue for two weeks and conclude at the start of the next project.

### Mid-challenge meetings

Because meetings are weekly and project last two weeks, every other meeting will occur mid-challenge.  Mid-challenge meetings offer a prime opportunity for Iron Coders to ask questions and bring forward issues that they have run into while working on their projects. This is a great learning opportunity both for the participants who have questions and those who can answer them.

### A fun and friendly environment

The purpose of Iron Coder is to bring together as many people as possible to support and encourage each other as we challenge ourselves to build our skills and abilities.  Be a constructive member of the community and please remember to remain positive and respectful of others at all times.

### Tracking our achievements and experiences

It is my hope that all who participate in Iron Coder will see a noticeable improvement in their coding ability as well as their confidence in solving technical problems. At times, it can be difficult to see the improvements that we have forged within ourselves. Blogging or documenting experiences and achievements is a great way to track just how much we have done to improve ourselves.

Because of this, all participants are encouraged to document their experiences and achievements either individually or as part of the group.

## We speak your language

Iron Coder is language agnostic, meaning that there is no single language for the group.  This means that participants are free to develop their solutions in the language of their choice. There are many languages available to developers and more are being made all the time.  Most of these have some concepts in common and will share some syntax.  Exposure to a diversity of languages is a good thing and is embraced by Iron Coders.

## How to get involved

Iron Coders will meet for live Hangouts on Air every Friday at 9pm ET.  The sessions will be available online afterwards for any sessions that you may have missed.  We look forward to seeing you there.
